Hardware Intro
- Arduino Uno
- Uses serial bus (USB) to connect hardware to software
- Arduino is just a circuit board w/ a microcontroller to delegate between input/output
- Serial buses/ parallel buses transfer data via in and out of terminals
- USB -> Serial port: How does information cross omni-directional?
- 20 different general purpose input / output pins (GPIO)
- Arduino shields are add-ons that achieve specific functions (like building a computer)
- Arduino Uno Rev3 has a USB-A port? Instead of USB-AB (printer port)?
- TX and RX pins are used for comms 
- PWM -> pulse width modulation
	Changes voltage (low, high) at different frequencies
- 6 analog inputs
- Analog -> continuous variable voltage signal
- Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) -> Voltage
	ADC:   0  512  1-23	ADC val = 204.6 * Voltage
	Volts: 0  2.5  5	
- Power: USB port is great, you can also use a DC jack or V-in pin w/ limits of 7-20V (stick w/ 12V?)
- Reset pin and bottom are power
