Ok so using the Arduino docs in GitHub and I don't understand the point of creating two functions for initializing LCD-
I get the need to protect it and access with a public one, but init_priv() doesn't seem private??
Also assuming LCD_I2C::method() is lambda use like a command..? need to check 
	^ C++ "::" is a scope resolution operator
	ans: "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scope-	resolution-operator-in-c/"
