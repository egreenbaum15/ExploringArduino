Software Intro
- Called a "sketch" (eww)
- 2 main sections of body: void setup() and void loop()
- Arduino IDE has example code in Files -> Example with comments
- Set Arduino Board & Port to begin uploading code
- "Verify" button to build code
- "Upload" button to deploy code
- Arduino basically takes convoluted binary code (in which you have to manually store information in defined space) and uses C++ for code "scripts" (again ew)
